4. Wiki Viewing / Editing                                       *trac-wiki-view*

    The Trac Wiki view is for browsing an editing a trac websites wiki pages.

                                                                       *:TWOpen*

    To open the wiki view use the command :TWOpen [OptionalWikiPage]

    If no page argument is given the plugin will open the main page WikiStart
    by default

4.1.  Browsing/Editing                                      *trac-wiki-editing*

    The WIKITOC_WINDOW will show a list of pages. Scrolling up and down and
    Pressing <return> on a page will open the selected page in the WIKI_WINDOW

    Pressing <space> over the page in the WIKITOC_WINDOW will display the page
    in a browser

    Trac sites usually have a bunch of in built pages Trac* or Wiki* you can
    hide these from view by setting the global variable in your vimrc.  let
    g:tracHideTracWiki = 'yes'

    At the moment this is done with a simple regexp so if you name your own
    pages Trac... or Wiki... they will not appear on the Table of Contents.

    You can also load a page by pressing the usual tag jump <c-]> to open the
    page under the cursor. At the moment theres no page name validation so it
    will throw an error if you try an open a nonexistant page.

4.2. Adding/ Retrieving an Attachment                    *trac-wiki-attachments*

:TWAddAttachment [file_path]                                  *:TWAddAttachment*

    adds an attachment to the current active wiki page

:TWGetAttachment [file]                                       *:TWGetAttachment*

    gets an attachment from the active Wiki Page and save it to the current
    working directory.

    If a Wiki page opened contains attachments The Wiki Attachment window will
    appear. Attachments can be downloaded by hovering over the desired
    attachment and pressing <enter>

4.3. HTML Preview                                       *trac-wiki-htmlpreview*

:TTPreview                                            *:TWPreview* *:TTPreview*

    displays the current wiki in html preview (only tested on lynx set
    g:tracBrowser)

    You can also use the shortcut <leader>tp

4.4. Saving Wiki's                                               *trac-wiki-save*

    To save a page you can type in the command view 
    :TWSave [optional_wiki_update_comment]                             *:TWSave*

    Alternatively you can quickly save a page with your regular :wq<cr> or :w<cr>
    which I've mapped to perform the TWSave? command.

    Exiting Trac Wiki View

    Exiting is done by either the command

    :TClose, :wq<cr> or :q<cr> in either of the wiki windows

4.5 Wiki Vim Diffs                                              *trac-wiki-diff*

    :TTFilterOwner      [Owner]                                 *:TTFilterOwner*

    For filtering on respective ticket attributes. Allows a tab complete option
    for Filter acts as a whitelist ignoring all other tickets not matching the
    attribute

    :TTIgnoreMilestone  [Milestone]                         *:TTIgnoreMilestone*
    :TTIgnoreType       [Type]                                   *:TTIgnoreType*

    :TTIgnoreNoMilestone [NoMilestone]                    *:TTIgnoreNoMilestone*
    :TTIgnoreNoOwner     [NoOwner]                            *:TTIgnoreNoOwner*

        Filter numbers and descriptions are displayed at the top of the ticket
        list. Using this filter will remove the filter number
    :TTListFilters                                              *:TTListFilters*

5.1.2 Ticket Sorting                                       *trac-ticket-sorting*

    :TTSortby [sort_option]                                          *:TTSortby*

    will appear in order of due date and ticket priority is arranged according
    to the trac-admin priority settings.

5.2. Adding Comments                                      *trac-ticket-comments*

    The TICKET_COMMENT window  is for adding comments. To commit a comment write
    the message first and then type 

:TTAddComment                                                   *:TTAddComment*

    :TTSetType       [Type]
    :TTSetStatus     [Status]
    :TTSetResolution [Resolution]
    :TTSetPriority   [Priority]
    :TTSetSeverity   [Severity]
    :TTSetComponent  [Component]

    The setting will immediately be sent to the server.

    Takes the text from the TICKET_COMMENT_WINDOW and updates a tickets
    description. It will prompt for confirmation before committing

5.4. Creating Tickets                                       *trac-ticket-create*

    This is still a bit of a hack. If you add a description in the
    TICKET_COMMENT window and type the command

    :TTCreateTask        [ticket_summary]                         *TTCreateTask*
    :TTCreateDefect      [ticket_summary]                       *TTCreateDefect*
    :TTCreateEnhancement [ticket_summary]                  *TTCreateEnhancement*

    A new ticket will be created with the default attributes (set in trac.ini).
    When creating a ticket you can create a description initially in the
    TICKET_COMMENT_WINDOW or alternatively you can add a description later
    using |TTUpdateDescrption|.

    :TTGetAttachment [file]

    Retrieves an atteched file and saves it to the current working directory.
    File options for the current ticket may be viewed with <tab> completion.

5.6. Ticket Sessions                                       *trac-ticket-session*

    It's possible to associate a list of open files with a trac ticket on the
    local server which can be handy for reopening tickets another day to make
    further changes. 

    Note: the plugin needs a directory to write to by default it is 
	let g:tracSessionDirectory = expand ('$HOME') . '/.vimtrac_session'

    TTSaveTicketSession                                    *TTSaveTicketSession*
        Saves the open files and line numbers to the active ticket. You must
        have a ticket open in the ticket view for this to take effect.

    TTLoadTicketSession                                    *TTLoadTicketSession*

        Loads the Tickets Session information

    selected
