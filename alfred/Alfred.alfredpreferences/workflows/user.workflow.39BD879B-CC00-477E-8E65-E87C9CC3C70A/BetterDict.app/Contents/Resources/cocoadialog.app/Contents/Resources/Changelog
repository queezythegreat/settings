NOTE:
Technically, yes, there are 3.0.0-betaX releases floating out there in the world that start with the major version 3.

Realistically, however, these releases never made their way into any sort of "official stable release" and were truly just alpha level experimentation. The code, features, and options were based entirely on cocoadialog 2 and do not reflect cocoadialog 3 in any way.

So for brevity and to avoid a "What happened to cocoadialog 3?" fiasco, we're simply going to ignore these betas and treat them like a couple minor version bump releases of cocoadialog 2 (e.g. 2.3.x, where "x" represents the "beta version").

	- Added --packages-as-directories option to fileselect.

2.0.0  Jan 2, 2006

	- Added secure modes for inputbox and standard-inputbox.

1.2.2
	- (Didn't release)
	- Allan's patch

	- (Did I even release this?).
	- Wout's patch:
	  added --no-show, --float, --timeout and --help options
	  turned into a background app so that the dialog icon does not show
	  up in the menu bar. This, together with float, is very useful for
	  loginhooks.

	- added dropdown and standard-dropdown controls.

1.1.3  May 11, 2004
	- fixed handling of multi-line input to progressbar.

	- starting to use x.y.z versioning (instead of x.y)
	- progressbar incorrectly printed error with --debug 
	  (runControlFromOptions: always returned nil, which should only happen 
	  on error).  This has been fixed.
	- progressbar character encoding bug fixed. should now properly handle
	  UTF8 labels read from stdin. see bug 942012 on sf.net page.  thanks to
	  J-F Boquillard for finding and fixing this.
