2013-01-22 20:25:47	einball	three pieces of metal (inner housing, outer housing, side panel), four heating elements from two pizza ovens, two solid state relays, rockwool, arduino, lcd, and a door also made of two pieces of bent metal and security glass
2013-01-22 20:26:20	linuxgecko	Seth: yes..  it could have been...  he tried to used my keys on my skull, i think..   i have a nasty gash above my eye, and one of my keys is bent some 30-45 degrees out of true :) 
2013-01-22 20:26:32	einball	The next revision will also encorporate a fan to allow for rapid cooldowns in case of sensitive components and BGA soldering on the same board
2013-01-22 20:26:53	SM0TVI	einball: Meh. $75 toaster oven, rip out themostat and knops, glue control panel on :)
2013-01-22 20:26:53	<--	Matthew (~mattintc@68-80-70-56.dhcp.aldl.mi.charter.com) has left #thegeekgroup
2013-01-22 20:27:20	Seth	linuxgecko: so you now know your skull is harder than the admitedly rather soft steel they use for keys.
2013-01-22 20:27:24	LostCanuck	homemade reflow oven?
2013-01-22 20:27:27	andi	wdorfner: are you using php?
2013-01-22 20:27:34	einball	SM0TVI: It is callibrated and uses a PT1000 with temperature compensation and a PID controller with software written in Qt (See, no pics online .. where's my head? Where's my head?).
2013-01-22 20:27:52	FunkEngine_	who pays $75 for a toaster oven?
2013-01-22 20:28:03	@Captain	Keys are made of brass typically, or worse. Human skull is 4x stronger than concrete by weight.
2013-01-22 20:28:08	einball	SM0TVI: Well, I aimed for something more reliable than a toaster oven. So I did it myself :)
2013-01-22 20:28:11	SM0TVI	einball: Even geekier method: Simple AVR with UART which basically streams raw temp readings from a Pt100/Pt1000 sensor and accepts input for relays. Connect to PC :)
2013-01-22 20:28:31	einball	SM0TVI: simplicity was not the aim :)

2013-01-22 20:29:17	Rocco	My only problem with a reflow oven is when i only care to reflow a single chip
2013-01-22 20:29:29	einball	SM0TVI: basically it's an arduino calculating the temperatures and therefore setting the output 10 times a second and reporting over its builtin usb serial interface to the program
2013-01-22 20:29:40	einball	Rocco: hot air gun :)
2013-01-22 20:29:52	Rocco	how accurate is that going to be :P
2013-01-22 20:30:08	SM0TVI	einball: Or solder braid pre-tin routine :P
2013-01-22 20:30:12	einball	the program will display the readings and the tempcurve that you programmed using the editor
2013-01-22 20:30:13	Rocco	I mean the xbox is already fucked so how much worse could i make it *CACKLE*

2013-01-22 20:30:33	einball	preheat
2013-01-22 20:30:44	Seth	Captain: when I was six, mine broke the windshield on a VW Beetle with no ill effect at all to me.

2013-01-22 20:31:13	linuxgecko	Captain: I'm glad.   but my guess of what happened is strengthed by the fact that this is not the first time that metal has glanced off my skull, but marred my flesh..   a fork one was once propelled from ~15-20 ft away, and glanced off my temple, and stuck in the skin :)

2013-01-22 20:32:34	linuxgecko	some people may think i have a hard head in a stubborness context..  but i now have 2 incidents that prove it's a physical reality, also :)
2013-01-22 20:33:16	andi	wdorfner: that could either work by executing a shell script (I'm not good with shell scripts so I'm not exactly sure how simple you can test the logins there) with php or using a php module which lets you access those users
2013-01-22 20:33:18	LostCanuck	to be fair, a hard blow to the head is less likely to completely penetrate the skull than it is to bash your brain with the acceleration =p
2013-01-22 20:34:05	dainichi1	wdorfner, look at various authentication packages. there's some that tie into the local authetication methods.

2013-01-22 22:37:39	Editor1979	Make the  periodic table so that each element can be removed. We can then take them out and use them to spell whatever we want. You could even sell each periodic element separately so if I need a specific element to spell something, I can buy them a-la-caret.
2013-01-22 22:37:42	@tysk	we are hard at work designing badges

2013-01-22 22:38:44	VivaPenguinos	Ohh, New idea, Make periodic badges of each element and make a velcro frame for the periodic badges, That way kids and teens can learn the periodic tables by putting the proper  location for each element.
2013-01-22 22:38:45	@tysk	how much would you pay for one?
2013-01-22 22:39:08	LostCanuck	That's a good question... Velcro backed periodic table..
2013-01-22 22:39:19	Editor1979	They would be magnetic and could be sold as a set with a frame holder or individual. I think it could also act as a geek puzzle.
2013-01-22 22:39:41	VivaPenguinos	make kids learn their periodic table
2013-01-22 22:40:00	LostCanuck	that seems like a $65-80 item, for probably 12x18"?
2013-01-22 22:40:01	VivaPenguinos	I'm sure many teachers would like the idea of having something like that in their classroom.

2013-01-22 22:42:53	VivaPenguinos	I'm thinking something where you have 118 seperate periodic badges with either a magnetic back or velcro. Then have a board designed similar to the periodic table.
2013-01-22 22:43:11	VivaPenguinos	That way kids can then put badges in the correct places thus learning their periodic table.

2013-01-23 00:52:28	wdorfner	ok so here's my question... 
2013-01-23 00:52:28	wdorfner	we have that samba share working in the church, is there any way to access it outside of the church? and still retain the login? some users upload files from home... linuxgecko suggested openvpn, i just want to get a good feel of my options...

2013-01-23 04:50:38	Obliterous	Monkeh: thats because you took the time and effort to get the offset so low. balanced amps produce best audio.
2013-01-23 04:50:56	Monkeh	Obliterous: Wasn't really much time or effort, it's naturally low in this config.
2013-01-23 04:51:03	davidjkuhr	I have a rack with 5 servers that now just sits because it consumes more power than its really worth to run for my needs.
2013-01-23 04:51:06	Monkeh	The Xonar suffers from a bit of unbalance, though
2013-01-23 04:51:16	Monkeh	23mV on one channel, about 6mV on the other.
2013-01-23 04:51:27	K1OCD-Adam	a bit? lol
2013-01-23 04:51:38	Obliterous	Monkeh: Yeah, tehats a lot of offset for headphones.
2013-01-23 04:51:39	Monkeh	A little opamp replacement should cure what ails it.
2013-01-23 04:51:56	Monkeh	Obliterous: Yeah, I was surprised to find those figures. Apparently some samples go up to 33mV or so..
2013-01-23 04:52:01	Obliterous	davidjkuhr: I have 24U rack at home, full, and fully utilized.
2013-01-23 04:52:05	Monkeh	REALLY pushing your luck with low impedance cans
2013-01-23 04:52:29	K1OCD-Adam	so a trans would be in order

2013-01-23 04:52:50	Monkeh	iirc I need to replace two of them
2013-01-23 04:52:50	DH8DL	someone cheer me up
2013-01-23 04:52:58	Monkeh	I think the third is only used for line out.

2013-01-23 04:54:34	K1OCD-Adam	2000x .. that the blackbox 2000?
2013-01-23 04:54:37	Editor1979	I'm about to post a couple pictures so you can see.
2013-01-23 04:54:41	DH8DL	last thing i did today was the final PA mosfet..still the same..not enough output (10-20 Watts ) instead of 50 and still no ALC
2013-01-23 04:54:56	DH8DL	no, the X is the normal version plus the 23cm unit
2013-01-23 04:55:01	K1OCD-Adam	k
2013-01-23 04:55:13	Obliterous	If the output is low, check the power side of it.
2013-01-23 04:55:18	DH8DL	did
2013-01-23 04:55:24	K1OCD-Adam	sure it was the finals?
2013-01-23 04:55:31	ki4rnk	deadmau5
2013-01-23 04:55:31	DH8DL	no
2013-01-23 04:55:47	davidjkuhr	lol Obliterous that is awesome.  My servers got turned off when I began renting a dual-quad xeon system in a datacenter in Chicago because it was cheaper per month and as powerful as my 5 old machines in my rack here.  I keep them around though just in case I have a project.
2013-01-23 04:55:52	Obliterous	if the final was bad, I'd expect nothing out.
2013-01-23 04:55:55	DH8DL	all symptoms showed it is a failure of one or more of the caps in the final tank filter
2013-01-23 04:56:03	K1OCD-Adam	what does the input side look like
2013-01-23 04:56:11	DH8DL	but i replaced all of those caps, replaced the Pin-diode too
2013-01-23 04:56:15	DH8DL	and the final mosfet
2013-01-23 04:56:37	K1OCD-Adam	are you getting full drive?
2013-01-23 04:56:46	K1OCD-Adam	to the finals?
2013-01-23 04:57:13	Obliterous	davidjkuhr: Yeah, sometimes it's cheaper that way. My power costs are so low that I can afford to keep old machines running. :-)
2013-01-23 04:57:15	K1OCD-Adam	and have you tried it with a test tone?
2013-01-23 04:57:16	DH8DL	inbetween i had it to do almost 50 watts on 439 mhz, but on 430-435 it did only 10 watts..without an ALC signal on the display
2013-01-23 04:57:43	DH8DL	i don't have the equipment to measure the output of the driver and pre-driver
2013-01-23 04:57:48	ki4rnk	anyone use barracudadrive as a server?
2013-01-23 04:57:50	K1OCD-Adam	sounds like you need to get into the svc menu and start adjusting

2013-01-23 05:02:10	davidjkuhr	I am currently paying $75 a month for the dedicated box and it has gigabit connection in the data-center and I probably see about 250Mbit/s symmetric to the internet with 10TB data transfer a month so I can't turn down a deal that decent.
2013-01-23 05:02:15	K1OCD-Adam	no .. geographic ares

2013-01-23 05:02:20	ki4rnk	oh ok
2013-01-23 05:02:22	DH8DL	all i know for sure is that the transmitter PIN-diode was bad and a capacitor leading the HF from the final mosfet to the pin-diode..thats for sure
2013-01-23 05:02:43	ki4rnk	the #4 is geographic

Older stuff and cheap stuff are less likely to have protections like bleeder resistors.

2013-01-23 06:17:05	Obliterous	I watched the whole series aftter it ended. was annoyed at it more than once. generally disapointed.
2013-01-23 06:17:05	MadManMarkAu	I mean, why are they flashing :/
2013-01-23 06:17:14	linuxgecko	davidjkuhr: i sorta lost  it starting second season..  when all sense of who's on who's side turns upside down.
2013-01-23 06:17:22	MadManMarkAu	Also, are those power fluctuations I'm seeing every now and then?
2013-01-23 06:17:24	VTguy	late night low trafic
2013-01-23 06:17:34	MadManMarkAu	Ah, k
2013-01-23 06:17:37	Monkeh	linuxgecko: That's actually the point ;)
2013-01-23 06:17:43	DH8DL	traffic lights do the same here in the night..at least some
2013-01-23 06:18:00	Obliterous	I honestly liked the original BSG series more.
2013-01-23 06:18:04	MadManMarkAu	Australia is completely different. THey work 24/7
2013-01-23 06:18:07	DH8DL	mostly i guess it makes no sense to keep people waiting in front of red lights with hardly any traffic on
2013-01-23 06:18:08	davidjkuhr	The flicker is probably caused by the lights being out of phase to the camera
2013-01-23 06:18:10	VTguy	no trafic lights in the last two placed i lived
2013-01-23 06:18:31	DH8DL	so it's blinking to warn people that it's in night-mode
2013-01-23 06:18:39	DH8DL	also maybe it saves energy
2013-01-23 06:18:54	VTguy	its not night mode
2013-01-23 06:19:00	MadManMarkAu	THe church sign is having a conniption fit :P
2013-01-23 06:19:13	VTguy	just the way the do low trafic spots at night
2013-01-23 06:19:17	Obliterous	the night-mode for traffic signals is to reduce the delay for motorists.
2013-01-23 06:19:20	linuxgecko	Obliterous: in the new BSG,   baltar is actually understandable as a bad guy..   i never understood him in the old one.
2013-01-23 06:19:25	DH8DL	although..that traffic light only goes red (during the day mode) if a car is coming from the left or right..so..makes no sense to flash
2013-01-23 06:19:26	davidjkuhr	one direction of lights will flash yellow and the other direction (usually side streets) will flash red
2013-01-23 06:19:55	Obliterous	linuxgecko: he was very understandable in the original. the books helped a lot, too.
2013-01-23 06:20:04	MadManMarkAu	Ah, I see
2013-01-23 06:20:07	Monkeh	linuxgecko: Except.. he's not a bad guy. Entirely.
2013-01-23 06:20:11	Monkeh	It's a very complex show.
2013-01-23 06:20:14	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  never read the books..
2013-01-23 06:20:42	linuxgecko	Monkeh: yeah..     he's just insanely conflicted.  :)
2013-01-23 06:20:45	Obliterous	linuxgecko: in the original BSG, he was a very bitter man that wanted the race to die, because he lost his familly.
2013-01-23 06:20:51	linuxgecko	emphasis on insane :)
2013-01-23 06:21:02	Monkeh	linuxgecko: And yet, perhaps, the sanest of them all.
2013-01-23 06:21:10	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  i gues i never saw that part of the series.
2013-01-23 06:21:58	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  in the new BSG, i can totally see his slippery slope as he goes..   i never saw that in the old.
2013-01-23 06:22:05	Monkeh	Obliterous: Damn, this 2134 likes the low end.
2013-01-23 06:22:05	Obliterous	linuxgecko: I dont remember what episode talked about it. but before he went bug-nuts, he was a friend of Adama.
2013-01-23 06:22:22	Obliterous	the original starts after he bugs out.
2013-01-23 06:23:08	davidjkuhr	Yellow flashing means caution and red flashing means stop here so I would assume yellow flashing causes people to watch more carefully at night.  I know I do when I drive at night in town.
2013-01-23 06:23:22	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  bsg was good,  but the series i really followed most,   was Dr.Who.
2013-01-23 06:23:47	Obliterous	linuxgecko: and I've tried to watch DrWho, and I just can't get into it.
2013-01-23 06:23:49	Monkeh	Obliterous: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgqDtU8BXf0 Head-squeezing.
2013-01-23 06:23:55	linuxgecko	Obliterous: old or new?
2013-01-23 06:24:04	Obliterous	linuxgecko: New.
2013-01-23 06:24:22	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  did you see much of the old?
2013-01-23 06:24:39	Obliterous	saw a LOT of the old one. it was on after BSG. :-)
2013-01-23 06:24:47	davidjkuhr	I really liked Seaquest DSV and Earth final conflict.
2013-01-23 06:25:13	Obliterous	Seaquest was good the first season. season 2... not so much.
2013-01-23 06:25:23	baconfatlabs	Season 2 was horrible.
2013-01-23 06:25:50	VTguy	Dark Angel
2013-01-23 06:25:50	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  the new drwho is the best shot anyone has done at a reboot of it..  and the doctors are awesome....   and alot more....   like the doctor,   with a slice of master :)
2013-01-23 06:26:26	Obliterous	linuxgecko: I understand that people are really liking the new one, but it doesn't grab me.
2013-01-23 06:26:36	VTguy	Love Dr WHO
2013-01-23 06:26:54	baconfatlabs	The heavily unaired season 3 was even worse.
2013-01-23 06:26:55	davidjkuhr	Seaquest season 2 seemed like they tried to rush the writing like so many shows.
2013-01-23 06:27:28	Obliterous	davidjkuhr: the entire writing staff was replaced.
2013-01-23 06:27:30	VTguy	they made a 3rd season
2013-01-23 06:27:34	linuxgecko	Obliterous:  kk..  the new ones are very obviously, when you look in hind sight, planned as season-long story arcs.
2013-01-23 06:27:42	baconfatlabs	Yeah it's on Netflix VTguy
2013-01-23 06:27:59	baconfatlabs	I actually watched them this past summer.

2013-01-23 06:28:25	davidjkuhr	I like Dr Who but I have seen every episode of the new stuff so i'm waiting for new eqisodes.
2013-01-23 06:29:02	linuxgecko	davidjkuhr:  i have not seen any of season 7,    so please,  no spiolers :)
2013-01-23 06:29:32	davidjkuhr	Okay
2013-01-23 06:30:01	Obliterous	Maybe I'll try again in a few years.
2013-01-23 06:30:03	linuxgecko	davidjkuhr: woudl you say that with the exception of season 1 of the new,   each season has always tied the first episode to the last(excluding xmas specials)
2013-01-23 06:30:30	linuxgecko	well....
2013-01-23 06:30:37	 *	Obliterous just had a deep philisophical thought,,,
2013-01-23 06:30:39	davidjkuhr	Yeah that seems to be the norm
2013-01-23 06:30:41	linuxgecko	that's not completely true..  i guess.
2013-01-23 06:31:17	Obliterous	given the number of shows tht turn to total shit in their second season, maybe we should THANK Fox for canceling firefly?
2013-01-23 06:31:24	DH8DL	i liked the series better when David T. Russel was producer
2013-01-23 06:31:44	davidjkuhr	But it seems to be what they are shooting for
2013-01-23 06:31:47	linuxgecko	DH8DL:  which series?
2013-01-23 06:31:49	DH8DL	more drama in those episodes..since he left it mellowed out a bit
2013-01-23 06:31:54	DH8DL	Dr.Who

2013-01-23 06:33:10	DH8DL	Russell T.Davies...
2013-01-23 06:33:23	VTguy	did you get the movie too
2013-01-23 06:33:33	linuxgecko	DH8DL: i actually like matt smith as a doctor alot..    eccleston was a doctor for too short :-(
2013-01-23 06:34:15	davidjkuhr	Anyone here ever watch Earth 2?
2013-01-23 06:34:28	VTguy	yup
2013-01-23 06:34:31	VTguy	was ok
2013-01-23 06:34:32	Obliterous	Yeah.
2013-01-23 06:34:33	DH8DL	i didn't say i don't like Matt Smith, i liked David Tennant more, tho
2013-01-23 06:34:45	Obliterous	it was okay... not great, but decent
2013-01-23 06:35:10	linuxgecko	DH8DL: one of my favorite companion themes  started with "silence in the library" :)    talk about twisted family relations :)
2013-01-23 06:35:11	VTguy	David was an awesome as the Doctor
2013-01-23 06:35:23	linuxgecko	davidjkuhr: YEP... 
2013-01-23 06:35:37	linuxgecko	VTguy: i agree...    
2013-01-23 06:35:53	davidjkuhr	It had a lot of potential but it's second season killed it
2013-01-23 06:36:04	DH8DL	i definetely liked it more when Russell T.Davies was producer..and writer of many episodes
2013-01-23 06:36:25	linuxgecko	davidjkuhr:  i was saddened when it died :-( .. it was cool.
2013-01-23 06:36:52	VTguy	alot of good shows get killed to early
2013-01-23 06:36:53	linuxgecko	DH8DL:  he was a good influence on the series..   
2013-01-23 06:37:02	linuxgecko	VTguy:   like Probe :)
2013-01-23 06:37:04	DH8DL	Steven Moffat who is producer now wrote great episodes back then too ("Blink" for example, the first one with the weeping angels) but since he became head producer..i don't know
2013-01-23 06:37:25	VTguy	hmm not familiar with Probe
2013-01-23 06:37:50	linuxgecko	VTguy:  one of the few series i know that asimov  involved..  IRRC.

2013-01-23 06:39:47	Monkeh	SGU was just getting started when they killed it.
2013-01-23 06:39:52	Monkeh	They moved too slow in the first season

2013-01-23 06:40:18	Monkeh	They killed an entire franchise with that move
2013-01-23 06:40:35	 *	linuxgecko never knew SGU got canned..    i lost interest when the guy who cracked the codes..  started goofing up.
2013-01-23 06:40:54	VTguy	ya thats why it got canned i think
2013-01-23 06:41:34	Monkeh	It got canned due to poor initial viewing. It was too slow moving. The second season really picked up, but they'd already lost too many viewers.
2013-01-23 06:41:49	VTguy	true
2013-01-23 06:42:23	davidjkuhr	They could have kept it going if the writing hadn't seemed hit or miss most of the time
2013-01-23 06:43:01	VTguy	but the thing is that they could possable bring it back but doubt it
2013-01-23 06:43:02	davidjkuhr	The worst part was the poor time slots they kept moving it to
2013-01-23 06:43:52	linuxgecko	probe was a "solve crimes by science" show well before it's time.
2013-01-23 06:44:05	davidjkuhr	yeah they could but I assume it will be a movie to test the waters before they would start another series.
2013-01-23 06:44:07	linuxgecko	well..   using science as a basis.. 
2013-01-23 06:44:34	Monkeh	VTguy: They can't bring it back unless a studio backs them.
2013-01-23 06:44:37	Monkeh	Which none of them have.

2013-01-23 17:30:01	LostCanuck	So, I don't think we're at the "urgent donation drive" status anymore, considering we've completely blasted past the goal
2013-01-23 17:30:23	deef	We're at "lesser urgency, but still cool".
2013-01-23 17:30:27	tysk	lol
2013-01-23 17:30:35	MrRobSteel	still something like $1200 short of the bills I think
2013-01-23 17:30:35	tysk	We're still 1200 short but we set the goal a little low.
2013-01-23 17:30:36	tysk	So.

2013-01-23 17:31:58	@CaptainNiobe	oh, god, now i feel bad... which isn't unusual or me... lol... would have set the goal for 7k had i felt we could have acheieved it... :-\

2013-01-23 17:32:54	@CaptainNiobe	8.4k in a month, 2 drives
2013-01-23 17:33:01	deef	Pretty impressive, to be honest. Like, revolutionary.
2013-01-23 17:33:01	LostCanuck	Yup
2013-01-23 17:33:05	VTguy	yes Lostcanuck
2013-01-23 17:33:09	LostCanuck	not gonna happen every month =p
2013-01-23 17:33:41	@CaptainNiobe	no... and i don't expect it to, all i wanted to do was try to help... that's what sparked my topic change...
2013-01-23 17:33:51	deef	Oh no. But, to fill a gap in times of need, very impressive.
2013-01-23 17:33:52	tysk	The goal is basically to gather some of our more passive-viewing geeks to be more directly involved
2013-01-23 17:33:55	LostCanuck	hell, once TGG is open, there're all those juicy grants they'll have access to.
2013-01-23 17:34:09	tysk	and then this kind of thing can happen every month, easily, with nobody needing to contribute more than say $20.
2013-01-23 17:34:11	einball	i thought tgg was already open?
2013-01-23 17:34:19	tysk	We're open to members not but the public.
2013-01-23 17:34:26	einball	ah okay
2013-01-23 17:34:55	LostCanuck	there's a big difference. a lot more money out there for a group like this open to the public
2013-01-23 17:35:17	@CaptainNiobe	hopefully we won't see such an issue again though, or at the very least, not for another 12 months... though not at all it preferred...

2013-01-23 18:09:45	LostCanuck	deef - sadly, not that high level. 1st year =p
2013-01-23 18:09:47	SM0TVI	Phil: Yah, but packets getting dropped on the floor is more of a PiTA with udp :/
2013-01-23 18:10:09	LostCanuck	deef - whole list of reasons, credits didn't x-fer exactly the same, screwed around right out of highschool, etc.
2013-01-23 18:10:20	LostCanuck	deef - by next year, I certainly hope these people have been weeded out.
2013-01-23 18:10:24	Phil	Streaming video with tcp is kinda dumb

2013-01-23 18:12:50	LostCanuck	deef - oh, I'm well aware. I was actually talking college credits. Did what I could, but when all you have access to is a community college, often those credits just arne't to the same level... essentially retaking the same course sI took last year, at a MARGINALLY higher level in first year =p
2013-01-23 18:13:23	deef	Haha. Yeah, your story sounds very familiar.
2013-01-23 18:13:47	LostCanuck	yup...
2013-01-23 18:13:59	deef	I did almost the same thing, except I jumped from a technicians program (after completion) into the more academic world of engineering, and suffered through all those growing pains.
2013-01-23 18:14:01	LostCanuck	so, pretty much: I know all of this -_- there is nothing new, essentially.
2013-01-23 18:14:11	deef	Oh well. Enjoy it while it lasts!
2013-01-23 18:14:11	SM0TVI	Phil: You would have to add FEC not to notice droppped packets, which would increase the overhead.
2013-01-23 18:14:24	LostCanuck	There's a reason why some of these courses I don't feel the need to attend constantly. like Programming

2013-01-24 05:04:54	DH8DL	i pushed my E8400 from 3,0 to 3,8ghz running stable on air with only minor voltage raise since 5 years now
2013-01-24 05:04:55	chris	it took alot of small tweaks to get it stable. 
2013-01-24 05:05:09	DH8DL	but thats not extreme
2013-01-24 05:05:17	chris	still not bad though 
2013-01-24 05:05:18	EpicIntelGamer	in my benchmarking rig I'm running a 3570K, most people dont go over 1.4volt, intel's recommended max is 1.52volt, I'm running it at 1.61volt

2013-01-24 05:06:46	chris	I dropped mine down to 3.8.  Did not need to run it harder then that 
2013-01-24 05:06:50	chris	nope all air cooled 
2013-01-24 05:06:58	linuxgecko	the whole idea of overclocking hinges on the padding of repeatability at manufacturing.   "ALL of our processors can do at least this..  "    and many may be capable of more..  
2013-01-24 05:07:17	EpicIntelGamer	and that repeatability is completely gone with intel Ivy Bridges
2013-01-24 05:07:32	EpicIntelGamer	I specifically, lost the "silicon lottery", got a real suckish chip

2013-01-24 05:09:02	chris	since they are already phasing out the 1366
2013-01-24 05:09:21	EpicIntelGamer	they already did phase it out but a 960 will still keep up just fine

2013-01-24 05:10:14	EpicIntelGamer	he has i7 960
2013-01-24 05:10:14	davidjkuhr	With Intel and AMD being much more picky about binning chips the odds of getting a chip that gets a really decent stable overclock say 50% have gotten much harder in my experience.
2013-01-24 05:10:15	Aust_geek	Ow
2013-01-24 05:10:21	VivaPenguinos	ah so same as me

2013-01-24 05:13:39	DH8DL	it's a Striker II Formula and i was feeling Asus made test subjects of all the buyers of that board
2013-01-24 05:13:39	VivaPenguinos	went dead (which screwed up most of the hardware)

2013-01-24 05:13:55	VivaPenguinos	requires a 20A outlet if I want the full 1500 watt
2013-01-24 05:14:01	EpicIntelGamer	cut it off
2013-01-24 05:14:04	VivaPenguinos	15 for 1kW
2013-01-24 05:14:05	Mushi	I had a Gigabyte board that started BSoD 4 months into owning it. I sent it back to them with a note how to get it to BSoD pretty much on command. They sent it back completely unfixed telling me basically that I was a fucking idiot and their shit never breaks.
2013-01-24 05:14:05	davidjkuhr	I have had great luck with Gigabyte boards for the most part, but I don't overclock my main rig any more because its more than fast enough at stock and I need it 100% stable since it spend most of its time at 70% load
2013-01-24 05:14:05	EpicIntelGamer	put on normal plug 
2013-01-24 05:14:07	DH8DL	yes, 5 years now..thats why i said i need a new one

2013-01-24 05:14:27	EpicIntelGamer	but mushi the problem is that's a crap board you bought, you can get any crap board and have it fail
2013-01-24 05:14:44	VivaPenguinos	If you guy's want to give me something in the 1kW range I'll be gladly to take it
2013-01-24 05:14:48	EpicIntelGamer	take a crap MSI board for AMD for example, they suck ass, half the time the VRM's will just blow up
2013-01-24 05:14:51	chris	I have not tried one of their boards for a few years 
2013-01-24 05:15:05	Mushi	The problem wasn't with the board itself. I've had countless things I've had to send back. My problem was their arrogance in dealing with a defective product of theirs.

2013-01-24 05:17:58	DH8DL	almost killed the board

2013-01-24 05:22:07	VivaPenguinos	but the price to replace the batteries aren't no longer worth it.
2013-01-24 05:22:16	VivaPenguinos	since the UPS i have outputs Modified sine wave
2013-01-24 05:22:21	DH8DL	whenever you try to solder something on a mobo..those boards soak up heat like a sponge..so you need a big iron

2013-01-24 05:44:29	maglinvinn	it wasn't paul screwing me, but his business partner
2013-01-24 05:44:33	VivaPenguinos	which ehhh, I don't think I have THAT many car batteries on me
2013-01-24 05:44:36	Monkeh	That sucks
2013-01-24 05:44:40	maglinvinn	yeah
2013-01-24 05:44:46	VivaPenguinos	Lemme double check the specs first
2013-01-24 05:44:50	maglinvinn	i wouldn't dream of burning them because it'd screw paul.
2013-01-24 05:45:02	EpicIntelGamer	man I'm liking this IRC, gonna have to come here more often
2013-01-24 05:45:23	Monkeh	Well, if Paul's got any sense he'll edge him out.
2013-01-24 05:45:34	Monkeh	People like that are not good to do business with.
2013-01-24 05:45:42	maglinvinn	not really.  paul is the RandD, chuck is the sales
2013-01-24 05:45:48	maglinvinn	they're perfectly symbiotic
2013-01-24 05:46:01	maglinvinn	but chuck holds more of the marbles.
2013-01-24 05:46:24	Monkeh	Perhaps, but when you start losing employees like that..
2013-01-24 05:46:31	VivaPenguinos	8-12V,8Ah batteries
2013-01-24 05:46:39	Monkeh	I'm secretly hoping a business near me crashes and burns for that sort of thing.
2013-01-24 05:46:48	maglinvinn	*nods*  paul and chuck went to war over it, but there was nothing for it.  
2013-01-24 05:46:56	VivaPenguinos	so either they are doing 12-96Ah Config
2013-01-24 05:47:01	Monkeh	Got booted because I dared to be more competent than the manager's son.
2013-01-24 05:47:03	VivaPenguinos	OR 96V-8Ah
2013-01-24 05:47:08	maglinvinn	oooh.  that is bs
2013-01-24 05:47:13	maglinvinn	sorry to hear that man
2013-01-24 05:47:20	Monkeh	I wasn't even being paid, it was a trial.
2013-01-24 05:47:22	maglinvinn	frankly, thats why i'm trying to get my forge up and running.
2013-01-24 05:47:35	Monkeh	As soon as they realised I'd end up with his job in a few weeks..
2013-01-24 05:47:42	maglinvinn	be my own boss.  make my own product, sell it, paymyself based on my own success, and to hell with these shitbirds.
2013-01-24 05:47:45	VivaPenguinos	what arre you runnign when you had the UPS war last night?
2013-01-24 05:47:46	Monkeh	Out came the excuses
2013-01-24 05:47:49	VivaPenguinos	or yesterday
2013-01-24 05:48:16	Monkeh	maglinvinn: They've probably had to hire at least one more person because of that guy, too..
2013-01-24 05:48:39	maglinvinn	*nods*  they've hired two people so far and still can't get my job done.
2013-01-24 05:48:47	Monkeh	maglinvinn: He 'replaced' the previous guy who (supposedly) moved on peacefully to other things, they ended up hiring his son and a second guy to replace the one person.
2013-01-24 05:48:49	maglinvinn	at paul's.
2013-01-24 05:49:13	maglinvinn	so i totes feel you.
2013-01-24 05:49:14	chris	All of my computers and TVs are on UPCs

I have room on the rack I built for 2 more shelves of 4 batteries and that should give me way more than enough at full load even if the power is off for a few hours.

2013-01-24 05:50:41	maglinvinn	put a relay on it instead, and have the relay fire a red alert lamp or something, or have switchable outputs based on time of day.  arduino for the win.

2013-01-24 06:04:23	Monkeh	deef: ident exists for allowing discrimination between connections from a single host (one not under the control of those establishing the connections)

2013-01-24 06:44:46	davidjkuhr	It made things a million time easier to follow in fast chatrooms when each person was using different colors with high contrast.

2013-01-24 07:41:06	ZeroByes	yer 
2013-01-24 07:41:08	linuxgecko	jack shoudl be the new standard audio system, IMO..      it can do basically anything.. 
2013-01-24 07:41:16	Monkeh	I've never had much luck with jack
2013-01-24 07:41:30	Monkeh	Rather convoluted and it's NEVER managed to cope with system load in my experience.
2013-01-24 07:41:32	queezy	ZeroByes: jack is great when you are doing audio work, for normal use it's pain is ass
2013-01-24 07:41:37	ZeroByes	i hade more problem with pulse
2013-01-24 07:41:56	ZeroByes	i use to use it with montion
2013-01-24 07:42:02	linuxgecko	Monkeh: you probably tried to use it w/o a RT kernel...  and made it do too many things :)
2013-01-24 07:42:04	ZeroByes	motion even
2013-01-24 07:42:12	Monkeh	linuxgecko: Even with a realtime kernel.
2013-01-24 07:42:32	Monkeh	The concept of 'oh, btw, I want 25% of one of four cores to play a video' confuses it.

2013-01-24 07:42:56	Monkeh	Realtime audio processing, as ever, wants a dedicated processor.
2013-01-24 07:43:09	ZeroByes	only had 1 probem every so offen it was out of sync 
2013-01-24 07:43:10	linuxgecko	Monkeh:  the real beauty of jack is when using it to do REAL audio work,  like using ardour..     ardour doesn't make sense w/o jack... 
2013-01-24 07:43:19	Monkeh	And I don't mean a core in your PC, I mean a real audio processor.

2013-01-24 07:43:32	queezy	Monkeh: the point of jack is the ability to pipe audio in toolchain, from one process to another
2013-01-24 07:43:49	Monkeh	queezy: Which I never did manage to get it to reliably.
2013-01-24 07:43:59	queezy	Monkeh: me too :)
2013-01-24 07:44:28	queezy	Monkeh: but when it works, it great, especially for live stuff, filter and effects
2013-01-24 07:44:39	Monkeh	Again, real audio processor.
2013-01-24 07:44:44	Monkeh	Tool for the job.
2013-01-24 07:45:11	queezy	Monkeh: software vs hardware, hardware always wins

2013-01-24 07:45:25	Monkeh	queezy: Well, an audio processor is still software.
2013-01-24 07:45:35	Monkeh	queezy: It just has dedicated hardware to run it and no distractions.
2013-01-24 07:45:36	linuxgecko	some of jack at it's best..     there are 2 other videos in that series..  
2013-01-24 07:45:40	Monkeh	Purpose-built tool.
2013-01-24 07:45:42	VivaPenguinos	I agree Hardware > Software
2013-01-24 07:45:52	JoeK248	 iv got a cold ill ues an  arduino to fix myself lol
2013-01-24 07:46:02	queezy	Monkeh: usually when you use jack it should be only be doing audio stuff, then you don't have problems
2013-01-24 07:46:15	queezy	Monkeh: multitasking with jack is not good
2013-01-24 07:46:22	Monkeh	queezy: But there's no such thing as 'only audio stuff', and that defeats the purpose of using a PC.
2013-01-24 07:46:39	linuxgecko	queezy:  yeah..  but i don't want to flip a huge transfer switch to go from regular use to audio work.
2013-01-24 07:46:51	VivaPenguinos	what are you doing?

2013-01-24 07:47:30	queezy	Monkeh: it's like using a computer for a router, if you have huge trafic and you are doing something on the pc, you get packet loss...
2013-01-24 07:47:45	queezy	Monkeh: same with audio
2013-01-24 07:48:00	queezy	Monkeh: audio is more intesive, and the timmings are critical
2013-01-24 07:48:05	VivaPenguinos	I'm trying to figure out what is he doing
2013-01-24 07:48:33	Monkeh	queezy: ... I know how it works.
2013-01-24 07:48:48	Monkeh	What is the point of using a PC for realtime audio work when you cannot use the PC for anything else?
2013-01-24 07:49:05	Monkeh	It's no longer a PC, it's an overpriced, underspecced, power hungry audio processor with the wrong interface.
2013-01-24 07:49:12	Monkeh	So get a proper tool for the job.
2013-01-24 07:49:14	queezy	It's repurposing the hardware, to do something else
2013-01-24 07:49:39	queezy	You can do multiple things, but with audio that's not good idea, just saying
2013-01-24 07:49:49	Monkeh	If you need to do serious realtime, a PC is not the tool, no matter how you dress it up
2013-01-24 07:49:51	queezy	The same goes for rendering
2013-01-24 07:50:23	Monkeh	For 90% of what people use jack for, realtime doesn't make any difference except causing problems when it can't manage realtime.
2013-01-24 07:50:57	queezy	It's all a mater of the software, Polycom is a great example, their codecs run on standard windows machines, and it's one of the best teleconferencing codecs out there
2013-01-24 07:51:15	queezy	but they have a dedicated pc per codec
2013-01-24 07:52:06	Monkeh	queezy: Teleconferencing latency is dominated by physical limitations, not processing time.
2013-01-24 07:52:32	VivaPenguinos	it also has to route through networks and what not
2013-01-24 07:52:58	Monkeh	VivaPenguinos: Even then, the primary factor in latency is still physical.
2013-01-24 07:53:06	queezy	Yes and no, you have to compress the video stream, and I'm talking about full HD teleconferencing
2013-01-24 07:53:13	VivaPenguinos	depends
2013-01-24 07:53:14	Monkeh	Even if you transmit point to point microwave, c is only so fast.
2013-01-24 07:53:18	VivaPenguinos	Yes latency physical
2013-01-24 07:53:26	queezy	with 2 megabit uplink requirements
2013-01-24 07:53:32	VivaPenguinos	but if it's within the same location maybe not.
2013-01-24 07:53:37	VivaPenguinos	within a LAN enviroment
2013-01-24 07:53:46	VivaPenguinos	there is some cause you can never get a true RTS
2013-01-24 07:53:49	queezy	which is crazy for a full HD stream over the internet
2013-01-24 07:54:13	Monkeh	Perhaps someone needs to introduce them to the FPGA.
2013-01-24 07:54:23	Monkeh	Or better yet, custom silicon.
2013-01-24 07:54:35	VivaPenguinos	I haven't dived into FPGA yet.
2013-01-24 07:54:38	VivaPenguinos	so I can't vouch
2013-01-24 07:54:42	queezy	custom silicon costs 1 million minimum to manufacture
2013-01-24 07:55:00	Monkeh	queezy: How much do they and their customers spend on running dedicated Windows boxes?
2013-01-24 07:55:30	VivaPenguinos	there is still latency imo
2013-01-24 07:55:30	queezy	50 to 250 thousand dollars depending on the type of teleconferencing solution
2013-01-24 07:55:41	VivaPenguinos	even in silicon
2013-01-24 07:56:05	Monkeh	My phone can do realtime HD decoding (not encoding, I know, but bear with me) off a battery. My PC takes how much power to do the same?
2013-01-24 07:57:03	queezy	decoding is easy compared to encoding, plus the decoding is not being done on the cpu but on the gpu
2013-01-24 07:57:20	queezy	and the gpu has dedicated silicon for the given codec
2013-01-24 07:57:22	Monkeh	It's being done on custom silicon designed for h264 decoding on the GPU
2013-01-24 07:57:38	VivaPenguinos	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8
2013-01-24 07:57:39	Monkeh	So why are they using multiple gigantic Windows-based PCs instead of appropriate tools?
2013-01-24 07:58:00	queezy	Money, it's cheaper to develop software than hardware
2013-01-24 07:58:06	Monkeh	Again I ask
2013-01-24 07:58:19	Monkeh	How much are they and their customers spending on running these machines?
2013-01-24 07:58:31	queezy	fixing software is easy, than to respin silicon
2013-01-24 07:58:31	einball	de and encoding can both be done by hardware oO
2013-01-24 07:58:35	VivaPenguinos	Well you have to realize that people has to service them
2013-01-24 07:58:43	Monkeh	queezy: Then get it right before you ship it
2013-01-24 07:58:47	Monkeh	This thing called quality
2013-01-24 07:58:47	queezy	where each time you have to spend a minimum of 250 thousand and more
2013-01-24 07:58:54	VivaPenguinos	if it's pure hardware, servicability isn't as great unlike software
2013-01-24 07:59:00	VivaPenguinos	especially with upgrades and what not
2013-01-24 07:59:05	Monkeh	FPGAs can do a LOT of processing in realtime and they can be upgraded.
2013-01-24 07:59:28	VivaPenguinos	And serviceability compared to windows?
2013-01-24 07:59:33	VivaPenguinos	or PC
2013-01-24 07:59:37	einball	sure ...
2013-01-24 07:59:38	Monkeh	What servicing?
2013-01-24 07:59:43	einball	just use a ZPU
2013-01-24 07:59:51	queezy	Monkeh: some solutions are probably done in fpga, but fpga desing is much more difficult than software
2013-01-24 07:59:53	VivaPenguinos	if it's not working properly, troubleshooting
2013-01-24 08:00:05	VivaPenguinos	All I can say FPGA and PC has their own use
2013-01-24 08:00:18	VivaPenguinos	it just depends if it's justifiable
2013-01-24 08:00:30	einball	queezy: not that I know ... 
2013-01-24 08:00:41	Monkeh	VivaPenguinos: If it's not working properly, what the hell can you do from a stripped-out Windows PC running closed-source software without debugging symbols without even being onsite?
2013-01-24 08:00:56	VivaPenguinos	Closed source? Fuck that Linux.
2013-01-24 08:01:02	queezy	The processing power of a i7 is much greater than a fpga, fpga's are better when you need high parallelism
2013-01-24 08:01:05	Monkeh	We're not talking about Linux.
2013-01-24 08:01:15	einball	queezy: wrong.
2013-01-24 08:01:23	einball	It clearly depends on what oyu gonna do
2013-01-24 08:01:28	VivaPenguinos	You're talking about processing
2013-01-24 08:01:32	VivaPenguinos	not bandwidth
2013-01-24 08:01:36	VivaPenguinos	big diffrence
2013-01-24 08:01:41	einball	VivaPenguinos: no
2013-01-24 08:01:50	einball	When it comes to processing the bandwidth is important

2013-01-24 08:03:09	VivaPenguinos	GPU isn't FPGA?
2013-01-24 08:03:18	einball	no
2013-01-24 08:03:20	Monkeh	No, GPU's are not FPGA
2013-01-24 08:03:43	Monkeh	GPUs are much more specialised than CPUs
2013-01-24 08:03:51	VivaPenguinos	Cause I know GPU are designed for a specific purpose than CPU
2013-01-24 08:04:05	queezy	Monkeh: what i'm saying is software is cheaper than a fpga, a fpga is cheaper than custom silicon, depending on the product and market you chose the right solution for the problem
2013-01-24 08:04:06	VivaPenguinos	Certain stuff are much better with a GPU than a CPU
2013-01-24 08:04:30	einball	VivaPenguinos: FPGA's are programmable hardware. you define how it should work and the program is compiled down to netlists that flip the switches in hardware
2013-01-24 08:04:39	Monkeh	queezy: And I contest the usage of a general purpose OS on general purpose hardware as the right solution.
2013-01-24 08:04:47	einball	VivaPenguinos: But GPU's are hardwired.

2013-01-24 08:05:23	queezy	Monkeh: if the hardware is only doing that specific task, then it's not a problem, because you can optimize the OS for your task

2013-01-24 08:05:59	einball	And I doubt one can beat the bandwidth of 1,7GB/s .. And the encoding can be done in real time without a problem on a Virtex-7 GPU ... even more than one stream
